I made the decision to switch back to Google Analytics. Because my site isn’t big enough and I don’t write as much as I’d like to, I don’t get enough value from premium analytics.

Surprisingly, Google Analytics added more weight to the page, but was quicker to load. And since I don’t have any third party embeds or sending this data to any third party websites, I still don’t need a cookie consent notice."

One challenge Jack and Paul face will be convincing people to pay for an analytics tool when they can already use Google Analytics for free. Fathom costs $14 (roughly £10.50) per month for tracking up to 100,000 page views for unlimited sites which is very fair for improving the privacy of your customers. Understanding how your website is used is valuable to your business and is a worthwhile investment!"
