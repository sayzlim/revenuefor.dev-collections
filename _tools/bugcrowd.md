description="Whilst the sample sizes aren’t ideal for a direct correlation in regards to bug bounties, as a baseline we can similarly think in expected value. For example, if you’ve 100 paid bugs to your name, for an average of $1000 a bug, then you can realistically start to say that you have a $1000 return per bug. If each bug takes you sixteen hours of time, then you can state that your EV is $62.50 an hour worked. That said, it’s unlikely that you’re going to hunt for 38 hours straight, at least not over the long term. You need to adjust this calculation taking into consideration time spent reporting, time spent learning, conferences, illness, family and leave time. After doing all of that, you’ll arrive at a truer calculation that can help you decide if you want to approach bug bounties full time or not.
